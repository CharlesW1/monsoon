## 2025-02-11 - API Efficiency & Lookups
**Learning:** Connection pooling with `requests.Session()` provides a significant performance boost (~5x) when fetching multiple assets (like icons) from the same host. Algorithmic optimizations from O(N) to O(1) in champion lookups significantly reduce redundant computation in session updates.
**Action:** Always prefer `requests.Session()` for API clients and use hash map lookups for frequently accessed data.

## 2025-02-12 - Data Parsing & Initialization
**Learning:** Inconsistent data types in API responses (e.g., winrates appearing as both `int` and `float`) can cause parsing logic to fail silently, leading to redundant fallback network requests.
**Action:** Ensure parsing logic is robust to common type variations (using `isinstance(val, (int, float))`) to avoid expensive network-based fallbacks.

## 2025-02-13 - Parallel Initialization & Fetching
**Learning:** Parallelizing network-bound initialization (like `ApiService` components) and multiple fallback fetches (like missing winrates in `LoLalytics`) provides significant startup performance gains (~20-40%) without sacrificing code readability.
**Action:** Use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for independent network-bound tasks during application startup or bulk data retrieval. Always specify `max_workers` when calling external APIs to avoid rate-limiting.

## 2025-02-14 - Parallel Processing in ViewModels
**Learning:** Parallelizing network-bound data retrieval in the ViewModel's event slots (like `on_data`) significantly reduces the time the UI thread is blocked during session updates. For a typical ARAM champion select (10 champions), concurrent fetching reduces processing time by ~73% (~1.26s to ~0.34s).
**Action:** Use a persistent `ThreadPoolExecutor` in ViewModels that handle frequent, multiple network-bound lookups. Always use separate batches of futures for distinct data categories (e.g., team vs bench) to maintain list integrity.
